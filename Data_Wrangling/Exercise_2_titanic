## call dplyr and tidyr packages into the workspace

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
install.packages("tidyr")
library(tidyr)

## read in the initial data

refine = read.csv("titanic_original.csv")

## cleaning up missing values in embarked column

refine2 = refine %>%
  mutate(embarked = as.character(embarked)) %>%
  mutate(embarked = ifelse(is.na(embarked), "S", embarked)) %>%
  mutate(embarked = ifelse(embarked == "", "S", embarked))

## cleaning up missing values in age

refine3 = refine2 %>%
  mutate(age = ifelse(is.na(age), mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), age))

## alternative ways to populate age missing values
## median - eliminates outliers to an extent

## cleaning up missing values in boat

refine4 = refine3 %>%
  mutate(boat = ifelse(boat == "", "None", boat))

## cleaning up missing values in cabin number

## it doesn't make sense to fill in an arbitrary cabin number for empty values here
## missing values here could be for crew or for people who weren't allocated a room before boarding
## also could be staying with other people on board
## also may be because they died and we hadn't stored that information before they got on the boat

## adding column for has_cabin_number

refine5 = refine4 %>%
  mutate(has_cabin_number = ifelse(cabin == "", 0, 1))

## why didn't is.na work in the above piece of code?

## Writes new data to spreadsheet

write.csv(refine5, "titanic_clean.csv")
